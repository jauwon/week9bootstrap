    <!-- heres what our to do interface will look like, we want 
    1. A section where a user can insert a new to do and it to a table 
    but also we want tobe able to have in that table a place where a to do item can be deleted once completed!!!  -->

    <!-- To start lets start with a form that the user will be able to input a new to do list, and within that form we will be taking full advantage of bootstrap
    and we are going to use a card in it and it will have a row with multiple colums  -->

    <!-- we will first set the body class="container"  -->
    <body class="container-fluid">
    <!-- <img src="gray.floaty.dancer.png" height="300px"> <img src="purple.queen.png" height="300px"> <img src="Ring.Ling.png" height="300px"> -->
    <h2>Welcome to Healthcare World</h2>
    <br>

    <!-- then we will then create a new div, and this div will be our card again card is a bootstrap component and add some style to start!  -->
    <div class="card">
    <!-- We will then create a card body that will hold the bulk of our content -->
    <div class="card-body">
        <div class="row">
            <!-- Then we will house all of out colums within here we will have them be all the same length so they will not hold a number.  -->
            <div class="col-sm">
                <!-- then within here we will add another div and this one going to start to use form group, cuz of the way that it formats it.  -->
                <div class="form-group">
                    <!-- Then we create a label  -->
                    <label for="birthdate">Birth date</label>

<!-- So down here we will create a table for our to dos to be added to accordingly and just like the other html elements we want to reference it to an id
so it can be properly accesssed later on -->
<!-- After the id we are going to use some bootstrap style elements to style it accordingly -->
<table id="list" class="table table-dark table-striped">
    <!-- now we will start with our table rows, and our table headers! -->
    <tr>
        <!-- for our headers we will create one for the Healthcare Assessments, Date of Assessment, Results, and the Ations; our actions will have our buttons
             inside of it. -->
